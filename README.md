This is a repo for the game client portion of my [Picross Capstone Project](https://github.com/users/jaohara/projects/7/).

This is the actual game client that users will use - it will authenticate a user with Firebase Auth, pull puzzle data from Firestore, render the game board from the selected puzzle, handle the current game session, and create user play stats based on the result of game sessions.
